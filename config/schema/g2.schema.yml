                <p>When this setting is true, the latest random value is kept

                <ul>
                  <li>For small glossaries, it is usually best to keep it
                    saved, to avoid showing the same pseudo-random value on
                    consecutive random entry generations.</li>
                  <li>For larger ones, randomness will be sufficient,
                    and unchecking this setting will remove one database write
                    with locking.</li>

                <p>Note that this applies to random generation, but the random

                This will typically be done to replace the standard path (<code>/g2</code> for route <code>g2.main</code>) by a SEO-engineered path.</p>

              entry pages, and G2 own pages, typically for SEO purposes.
              The value can include @title which, if not empty, will be replaced
